God will prepare everything for our perfect happiness in heaven, and if it takes my dog being there, I believe he'll be there.

For where God built a church, there the Devil would also build a chapel.
		--Martin Luther
%
Sometimes we look at gay being a bigger sin than being proud or not telling the truth. I don't think God categorizes sins.
		--Joel Osteen
%
God gives some more than others because some accept more than others.
		--Ernest Holmes

For thousands of years, human beings have been obsessed with beauty, truth, love, honor, altruism, courage, social relationships, art, and God. They all go together as subjective experiences, and it's a straw man to set God up as the delusion. If he is, then so is truth itself or beauty itself.

God is another name for human intelligence raised above all error and imperfection, and extended to all possible truth.
		--William Ellery Channing
%
We ought to get out of the judging business. We should leave it up to God to determine who belongs in one arena or another when it comes to eternity. What we are obligated to do is to tell people about Jesus, and that's what I do.

God knows how many things a man misses by becoming smug and assuming that matters will take their own course.
		--Loren Eiseley

Art is elemental. Reason alone as it's expressed in the sciences can't be man's complete answer to reality, and it can't express everything that man can, wants to, and has to express. I think God built this into man. Art along with science is the highest gift God has given him.
		--Pope Benedict XVI

If God is slow in answering your request, or if you ask but do not promptly receive anything, do not be upset, for you are not wiser than God.
		--Isaac of Nineveh

I always had a desire to know asylum life more thoroughly - a desire to be convinced that the most helpless of God's creatures, the insane, were cared for kindly and properly.
		--Nellie Bly
%
It is the custom of the Roman Church which I unworthily serve with the help of God, to tolerate some things, to turn a blind eye to some, following the spirit of discretion rather than the rigid letter of the law.
		--Pope Gregory VII
%
I'm thankful God has given us the technology where we can see each other through Skype on the computer. It's not the same thing, but at least we can see each other. Imagine the time before when that wasn't available and people had to go defend our country. It's really hard. I go two weeks without seeing my family and I go crazy.
		--Albert Pujols

We make our friends; we make our enemies; but God makes our next door neighbour.
		--Gilbert K. Chesterton
%
I have a dogmatic certainty: God is in every person's life. God is in everyone's life. Even if the life of a person has been a disaster, even if it is destroyed by vices, drugs or anything else - God is in this person's life. You can - you must - try to seek God in every human life.
		--Pope Francis
%
I was very, very religious. And of course I wrote about it in 'Night.' I questioned God's silence. So I questioned. I don't have an answer for that. Does it mean that I stopped having faith? No. I have faith, but I question it.
		--Elie Wiesel
%
In this quest to seek and find God in all things, there is still an area of uncertainty. There must be. If a person says that he met God with total certainty and is not touched by a margin of uncertainty, then this is not good.
		--Pope Francis

I drank the silence of God from a spring in the woods.

Perhaps believing in good design is like believing in God, it makes you an optimist.

God forbid that the day should ever come when to be true to my constituents is to be hostile to the Union.
		--Jefferson Davis

God gave me some weird, beautiful scent that makes men and women go crazy. People compare it to Carvel. It is a whale of a smell.
		--Adam Sandler
%
I just hope people see that if God can do something beautiful with my broken pieces, then God truly has a plan for each and everyone of us.
		--Nick Vujicic

We cannot suppose therefore that God has made an order of beings, with such mental qualities and powers, for the sole purpose of being used as beasts, or instruments of labour.
		--Thomas Clarkson
%
Sorrow for sin is indeed necessary, but it should not be an endless preoccupation. You must dwell also on the glad remembrance of God's loving-kindness; otherwise, sadness will harden the heart and lead it more deeply into despair.
		--Saint Bernard

You can't expect to make all this money and not go through problems. You can't expect God to give you everything you want without taking something away.
