This past year has been something else... it's opened my eyes to many things and many people. It's had its ups and downs and ins and outs.

I think women should start to embrace their age. What's the alternative to getting older? You die. I can't change the day I was born. But I can take care of my skin, my body, my mind, and try to live my life and be happy.
