When you begin to worry, go find something to do. Get busy being a blessing to someone; do something fruitful.

Worrying will not solve your problem.

Too many Christians have a commitment of convenience. They'll stay faithful as long as it's safe and doesn't involve risk, rejection, or criticism. Instead of standing alone in the face of challenge or temptation, they check to see which way their friends are going.
