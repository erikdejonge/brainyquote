My architecture tends to be legible, light and flexible. You can read it. You look at a building, and you can see how it is constructed. I put the structure outside.

Architecture is not a profession for the faint-hearted, the weak-willed, or the short-lived.

Architecture was the last of the major professions to devise a formal 'cursus honorum' before its practice could be undertaken.

Every one who has a heart, however ignorant of architecture he may be, feels the transcendent beauty and poetry of the mediaeval churches.

I think architecture is rarely the product of a single ideology. It's more like it can be shaped by a really big idea. It can accommodate a lot of life forms.

In fact, it will be very easy to climb the building because of its shape and architecture.

Architecture is particularly difficult for women; there's no reason for it to be. I don't want to blame men or society, but I think it was for a long time, the clients were men, the building industry is all male.

I probably spent the first 20 years of my life wanting to be as American as possible. Through my 20s, and into my 30s, I began to become aware of how so much of my art and architecture has a decidedly Eastern character.

The intellectual force of the West is still dominant, but other cultures are getting stronger. I expect that we will develop a new way of thinking in architecture and urban planning, and that less will be based on our models.

In Rome, I particularly love the history, churches, sculptures and architecture and the fact that you can walk along a tiny cobbled street and turn the corner to find the Trevi Fountain. London is evocative of other eras and full of history.

In my experience, if you have to keep the lavatory door shut by extending your left leg, it's modern architecture.

One of the stated goals of the postmodern movement in architecture was a greater sensitivity to the people who live in or use newly designed buildings.

If architecture had nothing to do with art, it would be astonishingly easy to build houses, but the architect's task - his most difficult task - is always that of selecting.
		--Arne Jacobsen
%
In addressing a task, one almost always has several possible options, sometimes only a few, and they may all be practical and functional. But they lack the aesthetic aspect that raises it to architecture.
		--Arne Jacobsen

It was the drawing that led me to architecture, the search for light and astonishing forms.
		--Oscar Niemeyer

I came to architecture from building. Because my father was a builder, everybody was - and is - a builder in my family.
		--Renzo Piano

In architecture you should live for 150 years, because you have to learn in the first 75 years.
		--Renzo Piano
%
You have to accept as an architect to be exposed to criticism. Architecture should not rely on full harmony.

The history of the Jews has been written overwhelmingly by scholars of texts - understandably given the formative nature of the Bible and the Talmud. Seeing Jewish history through artifacts, architecture and images is still a young but spectacularly flourishing discipline that's changing the whole story.

I always wanted to be an actor, but I always loved design, and growing up in New Orleans there was such great style, great architecture. I would decorate my little apartment in New York over and over again, because it only had a couple of rooms. And I did it for friends and family on the side just for fun.
		--Bryan Batt
%
I strive for an architecture from which nothing can be taken away.

People kind of tend to mystify design and architecture by suggesting you need to train.

All architecture, classical or not, must have some sense of order, and order is much harder to achieve without the straight lines and right angles that have dominated the building art from time immemorial.
		--Martin Filler
%
By 1970, the first stirrings of the revolt against Modernist orthodoxy in architecture had been felt, although it would be several years more until Postmodernism was widely accepted and made classical motifs permissible in high-style building design for the first time in decades.

I truly believe that the great heroes that create the history of architecture are people who take risks and write to tell about it.
