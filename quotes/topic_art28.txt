The roles of art, morality, religion, political faith, science itself are not to repair organic exhaustion nor to provide sound functioning of the organs. All this supraphysical life is built and expanded not because of the demands of the cosmic environment but because of the demands of the social environment.

In India, music is not given its due. Music is still treated as a hobby. Art does not have that recognition, be it music, writing, literature or sports. In the West, a famed singer or Hollywood actor generates equal respect and weightage as compared to a scientist. But science, engineering or M.B.A. are still the most sought after professions here.
