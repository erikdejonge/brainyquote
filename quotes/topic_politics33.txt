A passion for politics stems usually from an insatiable need, either for power, or for friendship and adulation, or a combination of both.

If you have a deep-seated need to be loved and admired every day, you shouldn't be in politics. You should go work at a pet store.

I mean, the part you don't like, I mean, that's the only part. That's the part no one likes, and that is the criticisms, and the unfair criticisms, I might add, of my husband. But that's also just a fact of life in politics.

Working together during the past three years, we have confounded the skeptics and the cynics. We've shown that here in Virginia, Democrats and Republicans can come together, put politics aside, and make tough decisions when times demand it.

For us, sons of France, political sentiment is a passion; while, for the Englishmen, politics are a question of business.

Mediocrity in politics is not to be despised. Greatness is not needed.
		--Hans Magnus Enzensberger

Only he has the calling for politics who is sure that he shall not crumble when the world from his point of view is too stupid or too base for what he wants to offer.

It was through the private world of family that the public world of politics came alive for me: living in intimate proximity with people for whom larger questions of ideology and belief, as well as issues relating to politics and governance, were vivid daily realities.

It's my view that human dignity - an attribute which for years has been taken by the Left in British politics - resides in fact in Tory values of independence, individuality and self determination.
		--Maurice Saatchi

My view on politics is much more grassroots oriented; it's not old boy network oriented, so I tend to, you know, come at it a little bit stronger, a little bit more street-wise, if you will. That's rubbed some feathers the wrong way.

Success in Silicon Valley, most would agree, is more merit-driven than almost any other place in the world. It doesn't matter how old you are, what sex you are, what politics you support or what color you are. If your idea rocks and you can execute, you can change the world and/or get really, stinking rich.

I was obsessed with politics in the '80s. I've recovered and I'm feeling much better now, thank you.
		--Steven Van Zandt

I think it is better when people with their own businesses and means of income join politics as there is some degree of honesty and integrity.

Look, not everybody plays well with each other on the playground. I get that, that's politics.

But we are entitled to look for continuity in politics.

I have been poor and I wanted to document poverty; I had lost a child and I was obsessed with birth; I was interested in politics and I wanted to know how it affected our lives; I am a woman and I wanted to know about women.

Basically, I have no place in organized politics. By coming to the British Parliament, I've allowed the people to sacrifice me at the top and let go the more effective job I should be doing at the bottom.

Politics, as a practice, whatever its profession, has always been the systematic organization of hatreds.

I believe that Greenland will achieve independence during the time I am still active in politics.

In the long march of history, at least two poles of attraction and antagonism have been the norm in world politics. Rarely has only one nation carried the burden of leadership. The unipolar world of the 21st century, dominated for the past two decades by the United States, is a historical anomaly.

Don't get married until you're certain that you're marrying the right girl. How did I know my wife was the one? I'd seen her for a couple of months. I liked her. She was a very creative person and she had a very good grip on politics and business.
		--Brian Wilson
%
I was really fascinated by politics. It always has been part of my view that politics really is a calling or you wouldn't go into it, because it's demanding and potentially has a toll on you and your family.
		--John Key
%
I'd just as soon not get into a discussion about Jane and her politics. I'd just as soon stick to what we're here for, the picture.

Fashion is not just about trends. It's about political history. You can trace it from the ancient Romans to probably until the '80s, and you can see defining moments that were due either to revolutions or changes in politics.
		--Daphne Guinness
%
You develop an instant global consciousness, a people orientation, an intense dissatisfaction with the state of the world, and a compulsion to do something about it. From out there on the moon, international politics looks so petty.
