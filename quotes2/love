The more often we see the things around us - even the beautiful and wonderful things - the more they become invisible to us.

Unconditional love really exists in each of us. It is part of our deep inner being. It is not so much an active emotion as a state of being. It's not 'I love you' for this or that reason, not 'I love you if you love me.' It's love for no reason, love without an object.

Some think love can be measured by the amount of butterflies in their tummy. Others think love can be measured in bunches of flowers, or by using the words 'for ever.'

It has always seemed strange to me... the things we admire in men, kindness and generosity, openness, honesty, understanding and feeling, are the concomitants of failure in our system.

And while men admire the quality of the first they love the produce of the second.

'Wedding Crashers' is a very soft movie in the way that it's emotional. It's about friendship, love and relationships. I tend to go to the light.
