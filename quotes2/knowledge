Your competition is not other people but the time you kill, the ill will you create, the knowledge you neglect to learn, the connections you fail to build, the health you sacrifice along the path, your inability to generate ideas, the people around you who don't support and love your efforts, and whatever god you curse for your bad luck.

Allah says in the Qur'an not to despise one another. So the criterion in Islam is not color or social status. It's who is most righteous.
