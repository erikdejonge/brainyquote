In your life, there will come a fork in the road, and both forks lead to flowers. One event for flowers is graduation. The other is the funeral of your child. You decide which road you want to take.

I have the cliche 'struggling actor' story. I was waiting tables in New York, went out to L.A. soon after graduation to get some jobs, but it didn't work out.
