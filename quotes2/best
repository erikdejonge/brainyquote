Purged of both hope and fear, we find courage in the face of helplessness, insignificance and uncertainty.

One of the ironies of a conference dedicated to all things digital and virtual is that the best ways to connect with people are surprisingly old-school.

Measles is probably the best argument for why there needs to be global health, and why we have to think about it as a global public good.
