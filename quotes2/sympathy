I have to express sympathy from the bottom of my heart to those people who were taken as wartime comfort women. As a human being, I would like to express my sympathies, and also as prime minister of Japan I need to apologize to them.

The novelist must look on humanity without partiality or prejudice. His sympathy, like that of the historian, must be unbounded, and untainted by sect or party.
	--Goldwin Smith

	--Anson Mount
%

	--Tim Kaine
%
You have to take strength from the people that love you and the people that love Barbara and the huge number of expressions of sympathy and compassion and support. That has been extremely moving.
	--Ted Olson
%
You have to have sympathy for and an empathy with a character in order to play them.
	--Laura Carmichael
%
All art is an intensely vulnerable gesture, and it is made with no small amounts of risk, and fear. So, I have plenty of sympathy for self-defense mechanisms, especially among artists.
	--Steven Erikson
%
I want the municipality to be a helping hand to the man with a desire of sympathy, to help the fallen when it is not in their power to help themselves.
	--John Burns
%
There's something very beautiful and compelling about someone who has ambition and someone who knows what they want, but it can get a little frustrating at times, so I understand that. I have sympathy for that.
	--Michael Ealy
%
Captain Hale, alone, without sympathy or support, save that from above, on the near approach of death asked for a clergyman to attend him. It was refused. He then requested a Bible; that too was refused by his inhuman jailer.
	--William Hull
%
I don't want to be entertained. I don't want visuals or musicals. I don't want a vacation. I don't want to quit. I don't want sympathy. The cry of my heart is 'Just Give Me Jesus.'
	--Anne Graham Lotz
%
In the eyes of the Catholic Church, abortion is a tragedy. Our principle objective must be to try and win greater sympathy for that perspective and for the value of human life from its beginnings.
	--Vincent Nichols
%
Sympathy is the first condition of criticism.
	--Henri Frederic Amiel
%
I am convinced that, despite what you think of Obama, I don't think Obama has a person-to-person connection with people. I think people love him because of his race and feel sorry for him, object of sympathy. I think people feel he's a victim, he portrays himself as a victim of America; he gets sympathy that way.
	--Rush Limbaugh
%
Our sympathy is cold to the relation of distant misery.
	--Edward Gibbon
%
I'm in total sympathy with Dick Smith's sentiments; I only wish there were grounds for saying we Australians would never tolerate such appalling treatment of refugees being carried out in our name.
	--Hugh Mackay
%
Sympathy is something that shouldn't be bestowed upon the Yankees. Apparently it angers them.
	--Bob Feller
%
I'm constantly amazed by the ability a child has to show sympathy, to read emotions, to get to the heart of any situation. It's unfiltered and completely inspiring.
	--David Duchovny

The true humanist maintains a just balance between sympathy and selection.
	--Irving Babbitt

Ultimately, we'll help the people we discriminate against if we try to understand more about them; genetics will lead to a world where there is a sympathy for the underdog.
	--James D. Watson
%
The relation of landlord and tenant is not an ideal one, but any relations in a social order will endure if there is infused into them some of that spirit of human sympathy which qualifies life for immortality.
	--George William Russell
%
Like many people, most Libertarians feel empathy and sympathy for less fortunate people. But they know you can't have perfection in a world of limited resources.
	--Harry Browne

I never ask for mercy and seek no one's sympathy.
	--Conrad Black
%
I have a great deal of sympathy for reluctant readers because I was one. I would do anything to avoid reading. In my case, it wasn't until I was 13 and discovered the 'Lord of the Rings' that I learned to love reading.
	--Rick Riordan
%
Since this war began our sympathy has gone out to all the suffering people who have been dragged into it. Further hundreds of millions have become involved since I spoke at Limerick fortnight ago.
	--Eamon de Valera

Sympathy for victims is always counter-balanced by an equal and opposite feeling of resentment towards them.
	--Ben Elton
%
There are times when a sports figure doesn't deserve sympathy.
	--Stephen Rodrick
%
It is by a wise economy of nature that those who suffer without change, and whom no one can help, become uninteresting. Yet so it may happen that those who need sympathy the most often attract it the least.
	--F. H. Bradley
%
When men are arrested without any legal basis and for political reasons, it's merely a routine, everyday occurrence in Russia, and hardly anyone has any sympathy.
	--Alexei Navalny
%
Recognition of belligerency as an expression of sympathy is all very well.
	--Henry Cabot Lodge
%
I am really drawn to damaged characters, and I have a lot of sympathy for them. Making those complicated characters empathetic is something to strive for. It's too easy to create a good guy or a good girl.
	--Paul Haggis
%
Sonia Gandhi and her husband have always been persons I look at with a lot of respect. Of course, one of the reasons we look at India with a lot of sympathy and enthusiasm is Sonia Gandhi. Now she is Indian, not Italian, but she will always represent a myth for Italians.
	--Luca Cordero di Montezemolo
%
I think we lost a great deal of sympathy and support with the way in which the crisis was handled, most importantly I think when we appeared to be grasping for too much at one time instead of identifying our priorities in a much more responsible fashion.
	--Billy Tauzin
%
If you want to devote yourself to the arts, you'd better do it strictly from passion, because there is zero guarantee that you'll get anywhere. The hardest thing is dealing with business people who have nothing to do with your art. They could care less that you're up at 4:30 in the morning writing a joke. Don't expect any sympathy from anybody.
	--Richard Lewis
%
The easiest way for readers to connect with characters and feel sympathy is to make the character entertaining, sympathetic and likeable.

Something that's seldom appreciated about me is that I am in sympathy with a great deal of what Marx wrote, except that I'm on the side of the bourgeoisie.
	--Niall Ferguson
%
My mother listened to all the news from the camp during the strike. She said little, especially when my father or the men who worked for him were about I remember her instinctive and unhesitating sympathy for the miners.
	--Agnes Smedley
%
As a Scot, I instinctively feel a sympathy towards a culture which is based on generosity. It's very refreshing. Afghans think they're the best people in the world and their country is the best place in the world, and it's strange because you go there and it doesn't really look like it, and yet they assume that everybody else envies them.
	--Rory Stewart
%
My guitar was loud as hell, and I had no sympathy for anybody else.
	--Brownie McGhee

Sympathy with nature is part of a good person's religion.
	--Francis Herbert Hedge

It is the right of our people to organize to oppose any law and any part of the Constitution with which they are not in sympathy.
	--Al Smith
%
The professional must learn to be moved and touched emotionally, yet at the same time stand back objectively: I've seen a lot of damage done by tea and sympathy.
	--Anthony Storr

Queen Paola and I will never forget the ties that have grown between the people and us during the course of the years. Thank you for your confidence, tokens of sympathy and support, sometimes even with a little criticism. We always loved you.
	--King Albert II

California must be all American or all Chinese. We are resolved that it shall be American, and are prepared to make it so. May we not rely upon your sympathy and assistance?
	--Denis Kearney
%
I didn't feel any remorse or sympathy if I injured a rival. I went over the top a few times but I never broke anyone's leg.
	--Peter Storey
%
Poetry is partly sympathy, don't you think? If it's any good, it gets people to think about others' points of view.
	--Edwin Morgan
%
In Shakespeare, unique individuals repudiate the stereotypes demanded by the structure of the play: Shylock commands our sympathy, Barnardine refuses to be hanged. Individuals trump the category.
	--Iain McGilchrist
%
There's a certain amount of sympathy here for the Bush administration's problem, which is they would like to get rid of Saddam Hussein and they would like to have the Kurds autonomous.
	--Les Aspin
%
He bit his lip in a manner which immediately awakened my maternal sympathy, and I helped him bite it.
	--S. J. Perelman
%
I sometimes get that wonderful sympathy between me and the audience, telling me I've reached their hearts. And when I do, the thrill is mine.
	--Kate Smith
%
I don't really distinguish between sympathy and honesty when I'm writing. The two go together - I'm interested in inhabiting my characters, seeing the world through their eyes.
	--Tom Perrotta
%
Reasoned arguments and suggestions which make allowance for the full difficulties of the state of war that exists may help, and will always be listened to with respect and sympathy.
	--Stafford Cripps

You will find that the woman who is really kind to dogs is always one who has failed to inspire sympathy in men.
	--Max Beerbohm
%
In fiction, imaginary people become realer to us than any named celebrity glimpsed in a series of rumored events, whose causes and subtler ramifications must remain in the dark. An invented figure like Anna Karenina or Emma Bovary emerges fully into the light of understanding, which brings with it identification, sympathy and pity.
	--John Updike
%
I felt bad when George Bush was booed. But only briefly. My sympathy for that man has a half-life of about four seconds.
	--Dick Cavett
%
I have every sympathy for writers. It's a mystery to me what they do. I can edit. I can cross out and say, 'I'm not saying that' or, 'How about we move this to here? Wouldn't that make that bit of the story better?' But where any of it comes from is beyond me. I will never write a play or a novel.
	--Alan Rickman
%
AIDS had won gays sympathy; they no longer seemed the privileged brats that the general populace had resented in the 1970s.
	--Edmund White
%
Despite my excellent mood, I don't have any sympathy for Romney. If he'd been a good candidate he wouldn't have had a different campaign for every month on the calendar.
