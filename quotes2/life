One of my great regrets, and I don't have many, is that I spent too long putting people's status and reputation ahead of their more important qualities.

A friend of mine said something powerful at his grandfather's funeral.

Being a survivor doesn't mean being strong - it's telling people when you need a meal or a ride, company, whatever.

All these things are qualities of survivors.
