Design is the fundamental soul of a man-made creation that ends up expressing itself in successive outer layers of the product or service.

I don't understand computers. I've been unable to construct a working mental model of how they do what they do. I can break software by looking at it. I can blow anything up. Without trying.

The Web is actually a coming together of three technologies, if you like: the hypertext, the personal computer, and the network. So, the network we had, and the personal computers were there, but people didn't use them, because they didn't know what to use them for, except maybe for a few games.

Over and over again, financial experts and wonkish talking heads endeavor to explain these mysterious, 'toxic' financial instruments to us lay folk.

Theaters are always going to be around, and doing fine. With computers and technology, we're becoming more and more secluded from each other.
