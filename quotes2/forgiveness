Christians - whether as a priest, a nun, a minister, whatever - have just been stereotyped to death. You try to be a model of kindness and love and forgiveness to all those around you, because you have received kindness and love and forgiveness from God through Christ. That's what Christianity is.

I'm not trying to convert the entire nation of Israel and the entire nation of Palestine to Christianity.

I'm a lapsed Quaker. I don't go to meetings any more. But I'm very drawn to Catholicism - all that glitter. I'd love to be a Catholic.

I don't think anyone who was ever born a Catholic hasn't died a Catholic, no matter how lapsed they are.
