Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life.

The threat posed by Bank of America isn't just financial - it's a full-blown assault on the American dream.

Even in a gleefully negative comic, there is optimism, although it's slightly hidden: It comes out through a comic character's sheer tenacity.

The lessons I learned from my mother and her friends have guided me through death, birth, loss, love, failure, and achievement, on to a Fulbright scholarship and Harvard Business School. They taught me to believe that anything was possible. They have proven to be the strongest family values I could ever have imagined.

The U.S. has a law on the books called the debt limit, but the name is misleading. The debt limit started in 1917 for the purpose of facilitating more national debt, not reducing it.

In truth, in the fairy-tale version of bailing out Lehman, the next domino, A.I.G., would have fallen even harder.

It has always seemed strange to me... the things we admire in men, kindness and generosity, openness, honesty, understanding and feeling, are the concomitants of failure in our system. And those traits we detest, sharpness, greed, acquisitiveness, meanness, egotism and self-interest, are the traits of success. And while men admire the quality of the first they love the produce of the second.
	--John Steinbeck
%
At the end of the day, you are solely responsible for your success and your failure.

I have self-doubt. I have insecurity. I have fear of failure. I have nights when I show up at the arena and I'm like, 'My back hurts, my feet hurt, my knees hurt. I don't have it. I just want to chill.' We all have self-doubt. You don't deny it, but you also don't capitulate to it. You embrace it.

Your personal life, your professional life, and your creative life are all intertwined. I went through a few very difficult years where I felt like a failure.

Starting a business isn't for everyone, and it's not what you should do if you aren't sure what else to do.

It's more often a life of failure than a life of success, and the majority of successes came after a long road of disappointment, and often shame.

Fear seems to have many causes. Fear of loss, fear of failure, fear of being hurt, and so on, but ultimately all fear is the ego's fear of death, of annihilation. To the ego, death is always just around the corner. In this mind-identified state, fear of death affects every aspect of your life.
