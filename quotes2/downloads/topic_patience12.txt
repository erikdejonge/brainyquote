Of course what happens is that nature has geared it, and I truly believe this, that the skipped generation is just ideal. We somehow have far more patience than we did when we were mothers. I think that the grannies are the ones who are supposed to take care of the children, while the young vigorous ones go back to work, just as they do in Borneo.

Becoming a father increases your capacity for love and your level of patience. It opens up another door in a person - a door which you may not even have known was there.

There's not a lot of room anymore for what I call 'made-up' drama. The drama comes from real places now - marriage takes work and focus, the kid stuff takes patience and commitment. And if you don't grow as people and as a couple, within all of that, then you've got some real drama.
