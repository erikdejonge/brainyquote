I have a lot of respect for the auto manufacturers. They make a product people live inside - and can die inside - so they are held to very high standards.

If you want to connect with people who are in distress and great grief and scared, you need to do it in a certain way. I move kind of slow. I talk kind of slow. I let them know that I respect them.

There's a lot of music at my fingertips that I can be influenced by. And just because I play a horn, I don't need to sound, or try to capture, what was happening before me. I can just respect it and learn from it.

I respect the fact that many denominations have different points of view with respect to gay marriage and they can hold that in the sanctity in the place of their religion and not bless them or solemnize them.

People always love and respect characters who speak the truth, even if the truth hurts.

Democracy arises out of the notion that those who are equal in any respect are equal in all respects; because men are equally free, they claim to be absolutely equal.
		--Aristotle

You can have a certain arrogance, and I think that's fine, but what you should never lose is the respect for the others.

Christlike communications are expressions of affection and not anger, truth and not fabrication, compassion and not contention, respect and not ridicule, counsel and not criticism, correction and not condemnation. They are spoken with clarity and not with confusion. They may be tender or they may be tough, but they must always be tempered.

I respect myself and insist upon it from everybody. And because I do it, I then respect everybody, too.
		--Maya Angelou

You must respect people and work hard to be in shape. And I used to train very hard. When the others players went to the beach after training, I was there kicking the ball.

I have many valentines. My mom and my sister and my directors. I got calls from all of them. And my friends. I respect what Valentine's Day stands for because it is about love.
		--Michelle Trachtenberg
%
And Barack and I were raised with so many of the same values, like you work hard for what you want in life. That your word is your bond; that you do what you say you're going to do. That you treat people with dignity and respect, even if you don't know them and even if you don't agree with them.
		--Michelle Obama

The British nation is unique in this respect. They are the only people who like to be told how bad things are, who like to be told the worst.
		--Winston Churchill
%
I'm free. I just do what I want, say what I want, say how I feel, and I don't try to hurt nobody. I just try to make sure that I don't compromise my art in any kind of way, and I think people respect that.

Nothing is more destructive of respect for the government and the law of the land than passing laws which cannot be enforced.
		--Albert Einstein

Globalisation has obliterated distance, not just physically but also, most dangerously, mentally. It creates the illusion of intimacy when, in fact, the mental distances have changed little. It has concertinaed the world without engendering the necessary respect, recognition and tolerance that must accompany it.

When you have that respect from your teammates, it makes it a lot more comfortable.
		--LeBron James

Teaching the history of the British Empire links in with that of the world: for better and for worse, the Empire made us what we are, forming our national identity. A country that does not understand its own history is unlikely to respect that of others.
		--Antony Beevor

I just want the same thing Joe Montana got when he was MVP. He got respect. He got commercials. He got everything.
		--Jerry Rice
%
The fact that the adult American Negro female emerges a formidable character is often met with amazement, distaste and even belligerance. It is seldom accepted as an inevitable outcome of the struggle won by survivors, and deserves respect if not enthusiastic acceptance.
		--Maya Angelou
%
There is no contradiction between effective law enforcement and respect for civil and human rights. Dr. King did not stir us to move for our civil rights to have them taken away in these kinds of fashions.
		--Dorothy Height
%
The British were indeed very far superior to the Americans in every respect necessary to military operations, except the revivified courage and resolution, the result of sudden success after despair.
		--Mercy Otis Warren

As more men become more educated and women get educated, the value system has to be more enhanced and the respect for human dignity and human life is made better.
		--Ellen Johnson Sirleaf
%
The sea speaks a language polite people never repeat. It is a colossal scavenger slang and has no respect.
		--Carl Sandburg

Since narcissism is fueled by a greater need to be admired than to be liked, psychologists might use that fact as a therapeutic lever - stressing to patients that being known as a narcissist will actually cause them to lose the respect and social status they crave.
