I, and others like me - trap stars - we always considered ourselves Robin Hoods: we go out and get the money.

In our situation, we took pride in getting money so that the hood could eat.

Abraham Lincoln comes from nothing, has no education, no money, lives in the middle of nowhere on the frontier.
