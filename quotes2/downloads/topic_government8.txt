It is horrifying that we have to fight our own government to save the environment.
		--Ansel Adams

As long as our government is administered for the good of the people, and is regulated by their will; as long as it secures to us the rights of persons and of property, liberty of conscience and of the press, it will be worth defending.
		--Andrew Jackson

Man is not free unless government is limited.

Obamacare is not about improved health care or cheaper insurance or better treatment or insuring the uninsured, and it never has been about that. It's about statism. It's about expanding the government. It's about control over the population. It is about everything but health care.

I considered myself engaged in a war from Day One. And my objective was to force the federal government - the Kennedy administration at that time - into a position where they would have to use the United States military force to enforce my rights as a citizen.

The basis of our political system is the right of the people to make and to alter their constitutions of government.
		--George Washington

Freedom of speech means freedom for those who you despise, and freedom to express the most despicable views. It also means that the government cannot pick and choose which expressions to authorize and which to prevent.
		--Alan Dershowitz

A government of laws, and not of men.
		--John Adams
%
That we we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain - that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom - and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.

The dangers of a concentration of all power in the general government of a confederacy so vast as ours are too obvious to be disregarded.
		--Franklin Pierce

By a continuing process of inflation, government can confiscate, secretly and unobserved, an important part of the wealth of their citizens.
		--John Maynard Keynes
%
Honesty, integrity, and accountability, the values, which should be the hallmark of this government, have instead been thrown under the bus by an arrogant majority, casualties in a misguided campaign to shield from accountability those who abuse this House.
		--Louise Slaughter
%
When the government violates the people's rights, insurrection is, for the people and for each portion of the people, the most sacred of the rights and the most indispensible of duties.
		--Marquis de Lafayette

Same-sex marriage is not the final nail in the coffin for traditional marriage. It is just another road sign toward the substitution of government for God. Every moral discussion now pits the wisest moral arbiters among us - the Supreme Court, President Obama - against traditional religion.

Poor people cannot rely on the government to come to help you in times of need. You have to get your education. Then nobody can control your destiny.
		--Charles Barkley

We don't walk. We overeat because we've made it easy to overeat. We have fast-food joints on every corner. By the way, the 'we' is all of us. It's not the government. It's all of us doing this together.

If you or I fail at business, we fail. If we cheat and fail, we go to jail. But if you're rich and politically connected, your incompetence may be protected by a government bailout.

Most of those coming from the mainland are very destitute, almost naked. I am trying to find places for those able to work, and provide for them as best I can, so as to lighten the burden on the Government as much as possible, while at the same time they learn to respect themselves by earning their own living.
		--Harriet Tubman
%
Our government is founded upon the intelligence of the people. I for one do not despair of the republic. I have great confidence in the virtue of the great majority of the people, and I cannot fear the result.
		--Andrew Jackson

There are no necessary evils in government. Its evils exist only in its abuses.
		--Andrew Jackson
%
A wise and frugal government, which shall restrain men from injuring one another, shall leave them otherwise free to regulate their own pursuits of industry and improvement, and shall not take from the mouth of labor the bread it has earned.
		--Thomas Jefferson
%
A government must not waiver once it has chosen it's course. It must not look to the left or right but go forward.
		--Otto von Bismarck
%
I'm not really conservative. I'm conservative on certain things. I believe in less government. I believe in fiscal responsibility and all those things that maybe Republicans used to believe in but don't any more.
		--Clint Eastwood
%
There is a higher law than the law of government. That's the law of conscience.
		--Stokely Carmichael
%
The government shouldn't be involved in this because it's very simple. If you don't believe in same-sex marriage, then don't marry somebody of the same sex.
