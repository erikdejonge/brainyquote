Warren Buffett is famous for talking about the 'intrinsic value' of stocks. But while many people parrot this phrase, few know what it really means.

Jack Palance was my distant uncle - that's the family gossip. Growing up, my family knew everything about his face getting burned and scarred in the military and how that mutilation led him to become such a famous 'heavy' in films. I prayed for good scars of my own. Not just acne scars.

I'm so famous, people expect me to sell as many records as Celine Dion or Puff Daddy.

Some of the most famous books are the least worth reading. Their fame was due to their having done something that needed to be doing in their day. The work is done and the virtue of the book has expired.

What I've learned is that you really don't need to be a celebrity or have money or have the paparazzi following you around to be famous.

That's the most terrible thing about being an author - standing there at your mother's funeral, but you don't switch the author off. So your own innermost thoughts are grist for the mill. Who was it said - one of the famous lady novelists - 'unhappy is the family that contains an author'?

I'd been working as a comedian since I was 21, and I didn't get the sitcom until I was 35; by then, I'd been knocked around quite a bit. Then I did the show for nine years, and I wasn't going out every night afterward. So at 44, I was unleashed on the world for the first time as a famous person of means. By then I'd gotten a good education in life.

Because you know when you first become famous, you start walking a little different because people are staring at you.

I had no desire to be famous; I just wanted to make the greatest music ever made. I didn't want anyone to know who I was.

A library, to modify the famous metaphor of Socrates, should be the delivery room for the birth of ideas - a place where history comes to life.

I was never very interested in boys - and there were plenty of them - vying with one another to see how many famous women they would get into the hay.

There's more pressure to be famous for being yourself than if you're being a character.

Comedy has to be done en clair. You can't blunt the edge of wit or the point of satire with obscurity. Try to imagine a famous witty saying that is not immediately clear.

Any idiot can get laid when they're famous. That's easy. It's getting laid when you're not famous that takes some talent.

I served the famous professors and scholars, and eventually they learned that the Reverend Moon is superior to them. Even Nobel laureate academics who thought they were at the center of knowledge are as nothing in front of me.

I learned a long time ago, if you want to keep your friends in show business, don't get famous. Because as soon as you get famous, a lot of the people you used to know, who didn't, become incredibly bitter and jealous. It's part of the territory.

It took me fifteen years to discover I had no talent for writing, but I couldn't give it up because by that time I was too famous.

What I can't completely understand is most other people's fascination with what the famous among us do with their lips and the rest of their bodies. Why do ordinary people become the target of this curiosity simply by virtue of the fact that other people recognise their names and faces but know almost nothing else about them?
		--Alan Alda

I felt so painfully isolated that I vowed I would get revenge on the world by becoming a famous cartoonist.
		--Robert Crumb

And to me, fame is not a positive thing. The idea of being famous is a lot better than the reality. It's fantastic when you go to premieres and people cheer you, but it's not real. And it's totally not my approach to get my name on a club door just because I can.

Aristotle was famous for knowing everything. He taught that the brain exists merely to cool the blood and is not involved in the process of thinking. This is true only of certain persons.

Sometimes you forget you're famous. You wonder, 'Why is that person staring at me?'
		--Bob Newhart

Part of being famous is offering up this blank screen upon which people can project everything, and it's a sacred act, putting yourself out there, in a way that lots of celebrities aren't steeled for; they're not prepared for the degree to which people define them.
