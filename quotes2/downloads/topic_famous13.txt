Fact is, famous people say fame stinks because they love it so - like a secret restaurant or holiday island they don't want the hoi polloi to get their grubby paws on.

I really feel like it's a travesty to make a child famous. I really do.
		--Joe Rogan

Before I became famous I had a very full life, and that gave me a lot to pick from. I always use everything. It always comes in handy. Working with animals... Well, I just enjoyed that. That was the most peaceful time.

I have a great job writing for 'The Office,' but, really, all television writers do is dream of one day writing movies. I'll put it this way: At the Oscars the most famous person in the room is, like, Angelina Jolie. At the Emmys the huge exciting celebrity is Bethenny Frankel. You get what I mean.

When you're rich and famous you are the dominant force in a relationship, even if you try hard not to be. I've talked of sacrificing everything for Fleetwood Mac, but I realize now that it is simply the only thing I've ever wanted to do.

You don't become a chef to become famous.

I would be a huge hypocrite if I didn't tell you that at one time in my life I thought the way that you made music was you got on a major label and you got famous.

I'm coming out with a wine... I'm actually a restaurateur. I have Famous Famiglia Pizzeria that has opened up in the Sacramento airport. I'm also working with my business partner on opening up the Linnethia Lounge.

I've had to deal, a lot, with my own sense of intimidation at meeting famous people - especially actors, but really any famous people.
		--Charlie Kaufman
%
I've always had confidence. Before I was famous, that confidence got me into trouble. After I got famous, it just got me into more trouble.
		--Bruce Willis

The death of a famous person is different from the death of a loved one, whether it is Michael Jackson, Frank McCourt, or Walter Cronkite. We didn't know any of them personally, and yet, we experience a sense of loss.
		--Madeleine M. Kunin
%
I was a guy who wanted to become famous. There was steam coming out of my ears, I wanted to be famous so badly. You want the attention, you want the bucks, and you want the best seat in the restaurant. I didn't think what the repercussions would be.

I know I'm not a self-indulgent idiot; I also know I'm not the second coming of Deepak Chopra. If I had believed either of those, or both, as some people do when they get famous, that's when the mental illness arrives.
		--Elizabeth Gilbert
%
I have a very down-to-earth father. My wife is an actress and famous herself is more down-to-earth than anyone I know.
		--Brad Paisley
%
I don't like being famous - it is like a prison. And driving for Ferrari would make it far worse.
		--Valentino Rossi
%
I was born in Glasgow. But my family is pretty much from a little town called Paisley, famous for its cotton mills and paisley pattern.
		--Gerard Butler

HBO is really famous for hiring good people and staying out of their way until they ask for help, or need it. And that reputation is earned.
		--Richard Russo
%
Major success feels a bit like a coronation. Like I'd become a king. I was one of the most famous people in the world, loved and hated in equal measure. I couldn't see anything bad with it. It made me a happy person.
		--Larry Hagman
%
I didn't know what to expect from a famous movie star; maybe that he'd be sort of stuck-up, you know. But not Gary Cooper. He horsed around so much... that I had a hard time painting him.
		--Norman Rockwell

You cannot hear the name Martin Luther King, Jr., and not think of death. You might hear the words 'I have a dream,' but they will doubtlessly only serve to underscore an image of a simple motel balcony, a large man made small, a pool of blood. For as famous as he may have been in life, it is - and was - death that ultimately defined him.
		--Michael Eric Dyson
%
I have smelled some very famous and undoubtedly sexy boys. And sometimes, as cute as they are, I'd rather have them as a friend - just because of the way they smell!
		--Rachel Nichols
%
I just want to make sure I'm contributing good films to movie history rather than being famous just to be famous.
		--Logan Lerman

Being famous is wicked. But it's better to be normal.
		--Rupert Grint
%
Celebrities have more influence to be able to reach out to people, but people are becoming famous on Facebook and social media every day.
		--Shemar Moore
%
The only reason I became the singer in the band is because I sang the best. It wasn't out of some desire to be a star or be a famous singer. It's not like I love interviews.
