I spent my childhood clad in 1970s hand-me-downs, primarily from male cousins, which mainly consisted of a selection of beige, brown and orange dungarees.

I think people are born bisexual and the make subconscious choices based on the pressures of society. I have no question in my mind about being bisexual.
