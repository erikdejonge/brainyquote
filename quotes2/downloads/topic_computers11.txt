We're getting so pulled in by computers and technology, and our kids have their face in the computers all day. The human relationship is being diminished by this.

People are seduced by signals from the world, but that is manipulation, not reality. Computers have learned more about us than we've learned about them.

The Semantic Web is not a separate Web but an extension of the current one, in which information is given well-defined meaning, better enabling computers and people to work in cooperation.

I started with CB radio, ham radio, and eventually went into computers. And I was just fascinated with it. And back then, when I was in school, computer hacking was encouraged. It was an encouraged activity. In fact, I remember one of the projects my teacher gave me was writing a log-in simulator.

People are good at intuition, living our lives. What are computers good at? Memory.

My dad used to work at IBM, so we used to get discounts on computers and stuff, and I did have a ThinkPad.

Not only have computers changed the way we think, they've also discovered what makes humans think - or think we're thinking. At least enough to predict and even influence it.

I loathe computers more and more, so I have one I can shut down and shelve like a book.

I've always been at the intersection of computers and whatever they can revolutionize.

Dell fills its computers with crapware, collecting fees from McAfee and other vendors to pre-install 'trial' versions.

The early cyberpunk idea was that networked computers would let us do our work at home, as freelancers, and then transact directly with peers over networks. Digital technology would create tremendous slack, allow us to apply its asynchronous, decentralized qualities to our own work and lives.

I'm not very technically minded. I mean, I don't know how to do e-mail on computers.

We could say we want the Web to reflect a vision of the world where everything is done democratically. To do that, we get computers to talk with each other in such a way as to promote that ideal.

Today, computers are almost second nature to most of us.

I hate the thought of my children being glued to a screen. Children only play on computers all day because their parents let them.

I don't care how big and fast computers are, they're not as big and fast as the world.

Why does everyone think the future is space helmets, silver foil, and talking like computers, like a bad episode of Star Trek?

Google is working on self-driving cars, and they seem to work. People are so bad at driving cars that computers don't have to be that good to be much better. Any time you stand in line at the DMV and look around, you're like, 'Oh, my God, I wish all these people were replaced by computer drivers.'

My goal wasn't to make a ton of money. It was to build good computers. I only started the company when I realized I could be an engineer forever.

People assume that computers will do everything that humans do. Not good. People are different from each other and they are all really different from computers.

Some claim that computers will, by 2050, achieve human capabilities. Of course, in some respects they already have.

As a child, I did what any normal kid who grew up without any electricity would do - I spent countless hours working on a computer wired to my parents' car battery... and learned how to code. This natural passion for computers lead me into the Internet market during the late 1990s and early 2000s.

The technological revolution at home makes it much easier for computers to do our work.

Technology is like water; it wants to find its level. So if you hook up your computer to a billion other computers, it just makes sense that a tremendous share of the resources you want to use - not only text or media but processing power too - will be located remotely.

By the time we get to the 2040s, we'll be able to multiply human intelligence a billionfold. That will be a profound change that's singular in nature. Computers are going to keep getting smaller and smaller. Ultimately, they will go inside our bodies and brains and make us healthier, make us smarter.
