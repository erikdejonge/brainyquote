Science is always discovering odd scraps of magical wisdom and making a tremendous fuss about its cleverness.

I am one of those scientists who feels that it is no longer enough just to get on and do science. We have to devote a significant proportion of our time and resources to defending it from deliberate attack from organised ignorance.

Political liberty, the peace of a nation, and science itself are gifts for which Fate demands a heavy tax in blood!

In the United States, one of the main topics of academic political science is the study of attitudes and policy and their correlation. The study of attitudes is reasonably easy in the United States: heavily-polled society, pretty serious and accurate polls, and policy you can see, and you can compare them.

To mistrust science and deny the validity of scientific method is to resign your job as a human. You'd better go look for work as a plant or wild animal.

Go beyond science, into the region of metaphysics. Real religion is beyond argument. It can only be lived both inwardly and outwardly.

Science has taught us, against all intuition, that apparently solid things like crystals and rocks are really almost entirely composed of empty space. And the familiar illustration is the nucleus of an atom is a fly in the middle of a sports stadium, and the next atom is in the next sports stadium.

Science gives us knowledge, but only philosophy can give us wisdom.
		--Will Durant

But perhaps the rest of us could have separate classes in science appreciation, the wonder of science, scientific ways of thinking, and the history of scientific ideas, rather than laboratory experience.
		--Richard Dawkins
%
That's the whole problem with science. You've got a bunch of empiricists trying to describe things of unimaginable wonder.

Science is basically an inoculation against charlatans.
		--Neil deGrasse Tyson

Physics does not change the nature of the world it studies, and no science of behavior can change the essential nature of man, even though both sciences yield technologies with a vast power to manipulate the subject matters.
		--Pope Paul VI

Politicians should read science fiction, not westerns and detective stories.
		--Arthur C. Clarke
%
Human relations are built on feeling, not on reason or knowledge. And feeling is not an exact science; like all spiritual qualities, it has the vagueness of greatness about it.
		--Amelia Barr
%
It seems to me that socialists today can preserve their position in academic economics merely by the pretense that the differences are entirely moral questions about which science cannot decide.
		--Friedrich August von Hayek
%
Before a war military science seems a real science, like astronomy; but after a war it seems more like astrology.
		--Rebecca West

Man has to awaken to wonder - and so perhaps do peoples. Science is a way of sending him to sleep again.
		--Ludwig Wittgenstein
%
The caricature of science is that we hold tight to the theories we have, and shun challenges to them. That's just not true. In fact, we hold our highest rewards for those scientists who can prove others wrong. And by the way, they are famous in their own lifetimes. We don't wait until they're dead.
		--Neil deGrasse Tyson

In science there is only physics; all the rest is stamp collecting.
		--Lord Kelvin
%
There's been some research in cognitive science, I'm told, that discloses that there have always been perhaps 10 to 15 percent of people who are, as Pascal puts it, so made that they cannot believe. To us, when people talk about faith, it's white noise.
		--Christopher Hitchens
%
We think scientific literacy flows out of how many science facts can you recite rather than how was your brain wired for thinking. And it's the brain wiring that I'm more interested in rather than the facts that come out of the curriculum or the lesson plan that's been proposed.
		--Neil deGrasse Tyson

Unfortunately the global warming hysteria, as I see it, is driven by politics more than by science.
		--Freeman Dyson
%
Science is an enterprise that should be cherished as an activity of the free human mind. Because it transforms who we are, how we live, and it gives us an understanding of our place in the universe.
		--Neil deGrasse Tyson

The thing about science fiction is that it's totally wide open. But it's wide open in a conditional way.
		--Octavia Butler
%
God created the world; the laws of nature were created by God. True science tries to find out what God put in the world. The trouble is where scientists speculate about theology and they don't know what they're talking about because they weren't there. They can't speculate about the origins of life because they weren't there.
