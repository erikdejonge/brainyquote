Poetry is plucking at the heartstrings, and making music with them.

I think there's just so many people in the world that don't feel understood, and when you hear a song and you go, 'Oh, that song understands me,' that's an amazing feeling. I get it when I listen to the radio... That's a beautiful part of music.
		--Keith Urban

There's something mathematically satisfying about music: notes fit together and harmony and all that. And mathematics has to do with abstractions and making connections.
		--Tom Lehrer

I want to party in space because I make alien music.
		--David Guetta

Doing things like playing music, something that's so natural and basic to human function, running around in nature, eating delicious food. These things are intrinsic in basic, primordial to human beings, so that's sort of a way to return to a blank canvas, allowing my true personality to return.
		--Ezra Miller

I'm not a goddess, for crying out loud. I'm a regular person who took feminism - which I have a deep connection to - and mixed it with music, which I really love to do.
		--Kathleen Hanna

I think you have to keep a childlike quality to play music or make a record.
		--Beck

If you wanna be famous, then it's okay if the music is fake, because fame isn't real.

Music is my 90% of my life and my biggest passion. I really don't have an interest in anything else.
		--Marina and the Diamonds

For me, visuals are as important as the music. I just love escapism and giving people something to escape to. To me, that's what art is.
		--Iggy Azalea
%
I've come to the conclusion that a long, personal relationship is next to impossible for me. Ultimately, music is a possessive mistress.
		--Leonard Slatkin
%
Music is my way out. I keep things locked up and never say anything. I guess in order to say something to one person, I have to sing it to a couple of thousand. It doesn't make for healthy relationships.
		--Florence Welch
%
Right around the end of the fifties, college students and young people in general, began to realize that this music was almost like a history of our country - this music contained the real history of the people of this country.

If you break up with your partner, go straight to the studio. You're going to make great music.

There are two things that I cannot live without: music and books. Caffeine isn't dignified enough to qualify.
		--Carlos Ruiz Zafon
%
I've always worked on all different types of music, some with specific project goals and deadlines and some not. Sometimes I would write a piece of music that is almost like a film score or weird electro pieces, wherever the muse took me, and I still do that.
		--Serj Tankian
%
I was in punk rock bands, heavy metal bands, world music bands, jazz groups, any type of music that would take me. I just love music.
		--Reggie Watts

The calm mind allows one to connect with the inner self, the Soul, the very source of our being. That's where the music lives. That's where my music comes from.
		--Clarence Clemons
%
I don't see it in terms of changing things, but rather using language and music as weapons for fighting a mainstream media which is predominately right wing, and loyal to the political framework and its corporate interests.
		--Thom Yorke
%
People say I seem very negative about new music - well, if somebody asks me what I think of Keane, I'll tell 'em. I don't like 'em. I'll obviously take it a step too far and grossly insult the keyboard player's mam or summat, but I'm afraid that's just me.
		--Noel Gallagher
%
I am a lover of all sorts of different music. I love blues and every piece of music that I have listened to has become an influence.
		--David Gilmour
%
Sometimes there's that perfect moment when the crowd, the music, the energy of the room come together in a way that brings me to tears.
		--John Legend
%
Oh man, I love what the South brings as far as the soul, and I really have noticed from even the early days of listening to OutKast and Goodie Mob that Atlanta and the South has a diverse sound to it. You have bounce music. You have soulful musicians. You have artists with vocals who try to do different things.
