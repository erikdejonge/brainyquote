That save from Pele's header was the best I ever made. I didn't have any idea how famous it would become - to start with, I didn't even realise I'd made it at all.

I was never about being a celebrity. Maybe when I was very young, but that goes away quickly. I've met almost every famous person I want to meet.

I guess some people want to be performers because they want to be famous.

You can win a talent show and be so famous that you can't walk down the street, but no-one knows you next Monday.

In the U.S. there are many people willing to work on $9 per hour, which is causing Tasmania to lose its famous apple industry and Australia to import more and more of its fruit and food from lower cost countries. In fact, all over Australia there are warning signs of us killing or restricting our own industries.

The thing is: in order to reach an agreement, to reach that balance, sometimes it is sort of like that old Rhinestone Cowboy lyric, 'There'll be a load of compromisin' on the road to my horizon.' For those of you who were too young, or don't recall the song, made famous by country singer Glen Campbell, it is your loss.

I have a famous brother, and I see what his life's like. He can stay places 15 minutes, and then he's got to leave. So I've seen what it's like to be famous, and I haven't really aspired to be a huge mega-star - not that I've had that opportunity.

You know, the more I appear on newspapers, the more famous I become.

I had no preconceived idea what fame would be like, because I never thought I would be famous. I just wanted to do my work. Hell, I just wanted to pay my rent on time.

If people just want to be famous, that's just not enough to get you up at 4 in the morning to go to work. You have to love what you're doing.

I'm English. Our dentistry is not world famous.
		--Christian Bale

I'm hardly the most notable person in 'Zombieland.' The other actors in it are way more famous than I am.

Hollywood's famous for putting you in a box.

I hate that tabloid idea of anybody who is famous having to forfeit their privacy.
		--Caitlin Moran

I wanted to go hide. I wasn't looking to be more famous, I'm famous enough.

Being famous hasn't changed my perception of myself - I've just grown up.
		--Cat Deeley

I'm focused on the next generation, because I think it's very hard to break the habit of adults who've got salt and sugar addictions and just ways of being in this world. It's very hard even for the most enlightened people at famous universities that are very wealthy to spend the money that it takes to feed the students something delicious.

Bill Cosby is a famous black guy who has a bully pulpit the size of the world; it's global. He puts his colossal foot on the vulnerable necks of poor people, and as a result of that, we don't have a balanced conversation.

The first pork-barrel bill that crosses my desk, I'm going to veto it and make the authors of those pork-barrel items famous all over America.
		--John McCain

For somebody famous, it's weird anyway to meet someone, because they have a preconceived notion of who you are.

You can be a famous poisoner or a successful poisoner, but not both, and the same seems to apply to Great Train Robbers.

Jason Lee is the most famous actor from Hawaii I can think of.

I'm really not for famous people who design a line for a company, when you know it's not really them creating it but a team of designers, especially when there are so many talented people who've taken the time to go and study fashion.
		--Bonnie Wright

I was never that famous, but I do think going to college and really getting away from the business and taking a true break is incredibly, incredibly important if you start acting at a young age.
