I have epiphanies all the time, because I'm always thinking. I'm a thinker. I'm always writing poetry, I'm always coming to conclusions.

Nobody ever told me what to read, or ever put poetry in my way.

I like to think that the best poetry is or involves a contest between ordinary conversation and ritual.

Poetry's always dead, you know? You don't realize how good poetry is until 15 years later.

Prior to Wordsworth, humor was an essential part of poetry. I mean, they don't call them Shakespeare comedies for nothing.

I published, privately, a collection of my serious poetry I had written over the years. I only published 50 copies, which I gave to friends, in a special deluxe edition. It was ridiculously expensive but I'm glad that I did it.

I'd always loved poetry and I'd always loved writing music and composing music, but I hadn't thought of putting the two together until around that time.

The last thing a young artist should do in poetry or any other field is think about what's in style, what's current, what are the trends. Think instead of what you like to read, what do you admire, what you like to listen to in music. What do you like to look at in architecture? Try to make a poem that has some of those qualities.

All poetry has to do is to make a strong communication. All the poet has to do is listen. The poet is not an important fellow. There will also be another poet.

Stadium rock and commercial rock are the opposite of what poetry needs. An audience of around 200 is ideal for poetry.

What does that represent? There was never any question in plastic art, in poetry, in music, of representing anything. It is a matter of making something beautiful, moving, or dramatic - this is by no means the same thing.

The Scottish Highlands are incredible. There seems to be magic and poetry everywhere.

My wife has been my greatest earthly inspiration. She excels in eloquence, the poetry of words, empathy and graciousness.

Since the printing press came into being, poetry has ceased to be the delight of the whole community of man; it has become the amusement and delight of the few.

Italian is the language of song. German is good for philosophy and English for poetry. French is best at precision; it has a rigour to it.
		--Maurice Druon

My art and poetry is very political now. Because you've got to find that truth within you and express yourself. Somewhere out there, I know, there will be people who will listen.

I don't think Auden liked my poetry very much, he's very Anglican.

Memory and poetry go together, absolutely. It is a matter of preserving and of remembering things.
		--Lisel Mueller

For a poet to depict a poet in poetry is a hazardous experiment; in regarding one's own trade a sense of humour and a little wholesome cynicism are not amiss.
		--Edward Dowden

Poetry is of so subtle a spirit, that in the pouring out of one language into another it will evaporate.
		--John Denham
%
Poetry is partly sympathy, don't you think? If it's any good, it gets people to think about others' points of view.
		--Edwin Morgan
%
I liked painting and drawing, and I liked humanities mainly - poetry, literature - this speculative attitude toward life.
		--Rafael Moneo

To feel most beautifully alive means to be reading something beautiful, ready always to apprehend in the flow of language the sudden flash of poetry.
		--John Holmes

I think poetry always lives its life, and people come to it and people go away from it, 'people' in the sense of larger numbers of people. It's as though you begin to think that poetry is a resource, and that at certain times people seem to need it or want it or can find sustenance in it, and at other times they can't.
		--C. K. Williams

I teach a lecture course on American poetry to as many as 150 students. For a lot of them, it's their only elective, so this is their one shot. They'll take the Russian Novel or American Poetry, so I want to give them the high points, the inescapable poets.
