I've watched a lot of people who became famous who completely change and I think it's because they tend to believe all the hype that's out there. I don't think there's that much hype about me.

I'd probably be famous now if I wasn't such a good waitress.

You know, I did not like being famous. It was a stressful and ugly time, and I'm glad it's over.

I was a shy kid, but somehow I knew I would make it as a performer. I'd always be telling my mum that I was going to be a famous singer. In my school yearbooks I would write, 'Remember me when I'm famous.' I knew I had a gift.

I walk the streets, take the train, it's real simple. Some actors create their own mythology: 'Oh, I'm so famous I can't go places, because I created this mythology that I'm so famous I can't go places.'

I know really, really famous people who are terrified every time they walk on to a stage.

I'd had people say, 'You'll enjoy being famous for a week, and you'll never enjoy it again'. But I don't think I had that week. I may have been working and missed that moment.

I don't feel famous.

When you look at Michael Jackson, there's nobody who loves him in that family, nobody. If they did, they'd tell him he didn't have to do all that in order to be famous. All he has to do is keep doing his music and be himself. Michael's been a little touched for about 20 years, but somebody needs to pull him aside and tell him they love him.

It feels like Radiohead are famous, but that no one knows who we are. Which is brilliant, really.

My father was famous for his photographic memory. He was in the OSS. They trained him to be captured on purpose and to read upside down and backwards and commit to memory every document in Germany he saw as he was being interrogated - every schedule on every wall. So, that photographic memory somehow made its way to me when I was young.

I just turned 40, and I look at so many performers and so many people who are actually always on time and always have an album out. They don't have actual lives, in my opinion. I feel like I'm so much more than being famous and meeting a musical quota. And I don't know, just the weight of the scrutiny and attention is too weird for me.

In Germany I am not so famous.

I wouldn't like to be that famous, I value my privacy. Mind you, Miss Piggy enjoys every moment of it. If it were not for me, she would spend all her time in the limelight.
		--Frank Oz
%
I don't really feel that famous. I think I lead quite a normal life with the occasional something a bit different. I like getting on the train and normal stuff like doing the dishes, because you can so easily lose your mind in this world where everything's done for you, you get picked up, driven to things, given stuff for free and all that madness.

I don't do ski racing to be famous.

I've always strived to be successful, not famous.

Of course, 'I Will Always Love You' is the biggest song so far in my career. I'm famous for several, but that one has been recorded by more people and made me more money, I think, than all of them. But that song did come from a true and deep place in my heart.

If you think Abraham Lincoln became famous for inventing the town car, it is time to spend a few hours on history.

Yeah, I love being famous. It's almost like being white, y'know?

Forget about being world famous, it's hard enough just getting the automatic doors at the supermarket to acknowledge our existence.
