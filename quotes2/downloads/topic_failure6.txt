It has always seemed strange to me... the things we admire in men, kindness and generosity, openness, honesty, understanding and feeling, are the concomitants of failure in our system.

And while men admire the quality of the first they love the produce of the second.

At the end of the day, you are solely responsible for your success and your failure.
