Overhead will eat you alive if not constantly viewed as a parasite to be exterminated. Never mind the bleating of those you employ.

In the old days, variety turns like me learned how to cope with failure - we all had nights when we 'died' on stage - but today's youngsters simply don't have that experience. For them, it really is instant make or break time - hence, all the tears and, hence, all the potential emotional damage.
