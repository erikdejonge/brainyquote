I am usually part of any disaster at a wedding if I'm a bridesmaid, which I've been lucky enough to be several times.

I would absolutely, definitely never sell my wedding pictures to a magazine. I'd like it to be a special day, not a photo shoot. And once you've done that, your marriage becomes everybody else's business.

Seriously I suspected I was a good actor, though I didn't know it during 'Monsoon Wedding.' Now I realize the more I learn, the less I know about acting... and life.

You can easily take photographs at a wedding - no one would question it. But funerals are different.

I met Jason on a charity walk in 2001, and we got married on a friend's boat in Panama two years later. It was the perfect wedding for two people who'd already been married and who weren't teenagers.

The only time I ever look good dancing is if I'm next to my dad at a wedding.
		--Cat Deeley

I ate no butcher's meat, lived chiefly on fruits, vegetables, and fish, and never drank a glass of spirits or wine until my wedding day. To this I attribute my continual good health, endurance, and an iron constitution.

Wedding is destiny, and hanging likewise.

I do not have a bride gene. I haven't been planning a wedding since I was 3. I never put a sheet on my head and pretended that it was a veil.

I used to work all the time, and now if there is a wedding, there's a concert, I'm there.
		--Petra Nemcova
%
My wedding won't be a hush-hush affair. When I get married, everyone will get to know about it... there'll be nothing speculative about my wedding.

It's always great to have things from France at a wedding. It's symbolic of style, of culture, of taste.

A big part of being in a wedding is the financial obligation, and that's something that people don't really talk about, but if you're asked to be in a wedding, you're gonna have to fork over some cash.

We are all so close. We are godfather to each others' kids. I was the best man at Jesus' wedding.
		--Juan Marichal

My family is almost exactly like the one in 'Monsoon Wedding'. We are very open, fairly liberal, loud people.
		--Mira Nair

I think the biggest thing that I have to do is to remind people that poetry is there for us to turn to not only to remind us that we're not alone - for example, if we are grieving the loss of someone - but also to help us celebrate our joys. That's why so many people I know who've gotten married will have a poem read at the wedding.

At my wedding, I was dancing so furiously that I fell hard on my kneecaps. The next morning, my knees were so swollen that I had to get a wheelchair at the airport to go on my honeymoon.
		--Casey Wilson

My grandfather Frank Lloyd Wright wore a red sash on his wedding night. That is glamour!
		--Anne Baxter

I have a crusade against fondant, also shortening. There's no reason why wedding cakes can't taste good if you know what you're doing.
		--Ron Ben-Israel
%
I saw a photograph of a wedding conducted by Reverend Moon of the Unification Church. I wanted to understand this event, and the only way to understand it was to write about it.
		--Don DeLillo
%
I've been married before, but I've never had my dream wedding in Vegas. I wanted to do it there because it's casual, quick, not religious and, most of all, very romantic.
