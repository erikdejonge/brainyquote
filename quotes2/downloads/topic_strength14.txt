Wrestlers and fighters believe that if they can drop down to the next weight class, they'll be bigger and have an advantage. What they don't realize is that they're losing all their strength. They're going to lose all their endurance. They're depleting their body of everything they trained for. You may still be good, but you're not at 100 percent.

God is waiting eagerly to respond with new strength to each little act of self-control, small disciplines of prayer, feeble searching after him. And his children shall be filled if they will only hunger and thirst after what he offers.

As much as we pump iron and we run to build our strength up, we need to build our mental strength up... so we can focus... so we can be in concert with one another.

There's something that's sexy about a guy who has the strength to kill somebody, but is also vulnerable enough to be in love. It's just those two sides - like, I don't know why, but women for some reason aren't attracted to normal guys, like, guys who are in between.

In some ways, I feel like the strength of animation is in its simplicity and caricature, and in reduction. It's like an Al Hirschfeld caricature, where he'll use, like, three lines, and he'll capture the likeness of someone so strongly that it looks more like them than a photograph. I think animation has that same power of reduction.

My greatest strength is common sense. I'm really a standard brand - like Campbell's tomato soup or Baker's chocolate.
