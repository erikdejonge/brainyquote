The mortal mind alone cannot devise an answer to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, because the true answer lies on a level of consciousness that's beyond our mortal thinking. Quite simply, when it comes to Israel and the Palestinians, we need a miracle.

We cannot know the whole truth, which belongs to God alone, but our task nevertheless is to seek to know what is true.
