For all the drama we all have with our families and all the tension and hostility, I couldn't have done this without my family. Being the people that they are - they're crazy - made it possible for me to be crazy and to live a lifestyle of my own design.

I was going to design sports cars, but my father came to my college to visit me. At the time he was making a picture in Sweden and he took me there with him.
