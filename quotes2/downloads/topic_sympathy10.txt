My upbringing has given me sympathy for the idea of isolation and what it is to be a new person in the room, where everyone else has some amount of familiarity and comfort.
		--Julianne Moore
%
As with the onset of sudden celebrity, for the newly rich, the world often becomes a darker, narrower, less generous place; a paradox that elicits scant sympathy, but is nonetheless true.
		--Felix Dennis

Most of my younger Native American friends are not in any way looking for sympathy, and they're not looking to lay guilt on anybody. They have their dignity, and they do what they do.
		--Robbie Robertson
%
It is in Rousseau's writing above all that history begins to turn from upper-class honour to middle-class humanitarianism. Pity, sympathy and compassion lie at the centre of his moral vision. Values associated with the feminine begin to infiltrate social existence as a whole, rather than being confined to the domestic sphere.
		--Terry Eagleton
%
NFL fans have less sympathy for fallen players than the Romans had for blind Christians.
		--Stephen Rodrick
%
Those who peacefully gather to express sympathy for the family of Michael Brown must have their rights respected at all times. And journalists must not be harassed or prevented from covering a story that needs to be told.
		--Eric Holder
%
Here's my rule: You always want to pay cash for your own books, because if they look at the name on the credit card and then they look at the name on the book jacket, then there's this look of such profound sympathy for you that you had to resort to this. It really is withering.

Any relations in a social order will endure, if there is infused into them some of that spirit of human sympathy which qualifies life for immortality.
		--George William Russell
%
I joined the Party definitely in 1923 after having already been in sympathy with it before.
		--Fritz Sauckel
%
Because I select my players from a feeling that comes to me when I am with them, a certain sympathy you might call it, or a vibration that exists between us that convinces me they are right.
		--Erich von Stroheim
%
According to your sympathy, you will take pleasure in your own happiness or in the happiness of other people; but it is always your own happiness you seek.
		--John Buchanan Robinson
%
There's no greater way to gain an audience's sympathy than by being unfortunate.
		--Seth Green
%
It's important to find characters that share sympathy with a young audience, not just in the story but their role in the world.
		--Tim Crouch
%
I have a lot of sympathy with the ideas and frustration of the Occupy movement. I absolutely agree with the sense that Wall Street has brought an economic calamity to the middle class and that no one has been held accountable.
		--Susan Bysiewicz
%
Although I'm Australian, I find myself much more in sympathy with the Austrian version!
		--David Chalmers
%
I have sympathy for anyone who finds consolation anywhere we can. And many people do find it in religious tradition as it has been. I mean, I love much of that tradition. But somehow, that just didn't speak to me in the way that it does to some.
		--Elaine Pagels
%
This sympathy is not translated into force against the British government because it is not like the anti- apartheid movement which had a high profile here and Mandela is a more engaging figure than Yasser Arafat.

Actors who are lovers in real life are often incapable if playing the part of lovers to an audience. It is equally true that sympathy between actors who are not lovers may create a temporary emotion that is perfectly sincere.
		--Ivor Novello
%
But what you could perhaps do with in these days is a word of most sincere sympathy. Your movement is carried internally by so strong a truth and necessity that victory in one form or another cannot elude you for long.
		--Hjalmar Schacht
%
A creative element is surely present in all great systems, and it does not seem possible that all sympathy or fundamental attitudes of will can be entirely eliminated from any human philosophy.
		--Morris Raphael Cohen
%
I have great sympathy for people that are infertile, but a life is not something you can give away.
		--Mary Beth Whitehead
%
The truth is that at the White House and in Congress, you are as likely to find sympathy for animal issues among Republicans as among Democrats.
		--Matthew Scully
%
I don't think it's an incredibly radical premise to try and have sympathy for someone who has made a mistake.
		--Joe Cornish
%
More negatives write than call. It's a cheap shot for me to go on the air with the critical letters or E-mail I get because the reaction of the listeners is always an instantaneous expression of sympathy for me and contempt for the poor critic.
